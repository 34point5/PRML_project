The original problem statement was as follows.

17 projections are listed in the excel sheet.
Go through the sites given in the excel sheet.
If you find too many classes, just take two classes and exclude the others. 

Apply Bayes' classifier using:
1 ML estimation
2 Bayesian estimation
3 EM algorithm
4 Kernel-based method
5 K nearest neighbor estimatition

and apply perceptron learning algorithm. (Stop criteria would be two or three passes of data.)
